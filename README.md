# Slowveld Candles 

### 100% natural say wax candles made in the african bushveld

Introduction into a custom built inventory management system.

High-level: 
The app is intended to mimic the inventory processes carried out by slowveld. 
Beginning with identifying items to be purchased as inputs, until eventually the finished good are delivered to the customer. 

The linear process: 
1. Purchase orders 

- identifying and procuring items/inputs to be used in candle making
- create purchase orders 

2. Stock

- Purchase orders on delivery of good get added into the stock (input materials)

3. Product

- build new products (ie New candle range)
- Add the inputs needed to create the product
- create products (subtracts inputs needed from stock) 

4. Sales

- create sales order
- add products to cart 
- once marked as delivered, products_on_hand are decreased
